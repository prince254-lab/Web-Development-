<p>There really is something about riding bikes. I love the freedom I feel while riding, it's always worth the effort. Even more than just riding, I love racing . I appreciate the challenge, and the fact that I will push myself harder during a race. The Breck Epic was a true challenge and test for me. In all honesty I was ill for most of the race. I chalk this up to bad luck on my part and am not too upset about the outcome. It could have been worse and I am lucky to be out there giving it my all and just riding my bike.</p>

<p>Cars are an essential mode of transportation used for leisure activities, work, or travelling purposes. Each new model of a car and its specific feature can determine its driving experience. Cars can be a safe way to commute to avoid close contact with the general public during pandemic situations. A car at home can be very beneficial in case of family health emergencies.</p>
